[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A Python wrapper for the data.gouv.fr API that allows you to interact easily with datasets, resources, topics, and published APIs (dataservices) across all three platforms (`prod`/`www`, `demo`, and `dev`). Install it through [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/datagouv-client/):
```bash
pip install datagouv-client
```

**Requirements:** Python >= 3.10

> **CLI users:** the command-line interface has moved to [`datagouv-cli`](https://github.com/datagouv/datagouv-cli). Install it via apt, Homebrew, or a release binary — see that repository for instructions.

## 🚀 Use

### 📥 Quick Start
```python
from datagouv import Dataset, Dataservice, Resource, Topic

# Get a dataset and its resources
dataset = Dataset("5d13a8b6634f41070a43dff3")
print(f"Dataset: {dataset.title}")
print(f"Resources: {len(dataset.resources)}")

# Download a resource
resource = dataset.resources[0]
resource.download("my_file.csv")

# Get a topic and its elements
topic = Topic("68b6e6dbdac745f47d4ff6e0")
elements = topic.elements
datasets = topic.datasets

# Get a published API (dataservice on the platform)
api = Dataservice("673b0e6774a23d9eac2af8ce")
print(f"API: {api.title}")
print(f"Base URL: {api.base_api_url}")
```

### 📊 Getting existing objects
If you only want to retrieve existing objects (aka you don't want to modify them on datagouv), here is what a workflow could look like:
```python
from datagouv import Dataset, Dataservice, Resource, Organization

dataset = Dataset("5d13a8b6634f41070a43dff3")  # you can find a dataset's id in the `Informations` tab of its landing page

# you can now access a bunch of info about the dataset
print(dataset.title)
print(dataset.description)
print(dataset.created_at)
print(dataset.organization)  # this is an instance of Organization
print(dataset)  # this displays all the attributes of the dataset as a dict

# and of course its resources, which are all Resource instances
for res in dataset.resources:
    print(res.title)
    print(res.url)  # this is the download URL of the resource
    print(res.id)  # the id of the resource itself
    print(res.dataset_id)  # the id of the dataset the resource belongs to
    print(res)  # this displays all the attributes of the resource as a dict

# if you are only interested in a specific resource
resource = Resource("f868cca6-8da1-4369-a78d-47463f19a9a3")  # you can find a resource's id in its `Métadonnées` tab
print(resource)

# if the resource contains tabular data that has been APIfied (see https://www.data.gouv.fr/dataservices/673b0e6774a23d9eac2af8ce for more info), it also has:
resource.columns  # the columns of the table, as a list of strings
resource.profile  # the profile of the table (number of rows, detected formats and types...)
for row in resource.rows(
    filters=[
        ("col1", "==", "6"),
        ("col4", "isnotnull"),
    ],  # filters is an optional argument to retrieve only the rows that match conditions
):
    print(row)

# you can also access a dataset from one of its resources
d = resource.dataset  # this returns an instance of Dataset

# you can also download a resource locally (**Note:** if it doesn't exist, parent path will be created)
resource.download("./file.csv")  # this saves the resource in your working directory as "file.csv"

# alternatively, you can load the resource directly into memory as a BytesIO buffer to process the content without writing it to disk
buf = resource.download_buffer()
# by default, in-memory downloads are limited to about 95 MiB to prevent excessive memory usage.
# Note: If you expect larger files and your infrastructure can handle them,
# increase the `max_mib` limit:
buf = resource.download_buffer(max_mib=200)  # allow up to about 200 MiB

# and a subset or all resources of a dataset (**Note:** if it doesn't exist, parent path will be created)
# the files are named `resource_id.format` (for instance f868cca6-8da1-4369-a78d-47463f19a9a3.csv)
d.download_resources(
    folder="data",  # if not specified, saves them into your working directory
    resources_types=["main", "documentation"],  # default is only main resources
)


organization = Organization("646b7187b50b2a93b1ae3d45")  # you can find an organization's id in the `Informations` tab of its landing page, in "Informations techniques"
# you can loop through the organization's datasets, which are Dataset instances
for dat in organization.datasets:
    print(f"{dat.title} has {len(dat.resources)} resources")

# Third-party APIs published on the catalog (listed under [dataservices](https://www.data.gouv.fr/dataservices/) on the website)
# are represented in code by Dataservice
api = Dataservice("673b0e6774a23d9eac2af8ce")  # you can find an API's id on its page on data.gouv.fr
print(api.title)
print(api.description)
print(api.base_api_url)  # the URL of the published API itself
print(api.machine_documentation_url)  # OpenAPI/Swagger spec, if available
print(api.organization_id)
print(api)  # this displays all the attributes of the API as a dict

# you can loop through the datasets associated with this API, which are Dataset instances
for dat in api.associated_datasets:
    print(dat.title)
```

> **Note:** If you encounter errors during API calls, the client will raise appropriate exceptions (e.g., `PermissionError` for authentication issues, `niquests.RequestException` for API errors).

> **Note:** If you want to get objects from demo or dev, you must use a client:
```python
from datagouv import Client, Dataset

dataset = Dataset("5d13a8b6634f41070a43dff3", _client=Client("demo"))
```

You can also access objects' metrics (views, downloads) with the `get_monthly_traffic_metrics` function:
```python
for month_metrics in Dataset("5d13a8b6634f41070a43dff3").get_monthly_traffic_metrics(
    start_month="2025-01",  # optional, goes back as far as possible if not set
    end_month="2025-06",  # optional, until today if not set
):
    print(month_metrics)
```
The metrics differ depending on the object:
- for datasets:
```json
{
    "__id": 43110395,
    "dataset_id": "6789251f3a805425afee55e6",
    "metric_month": "2025-01",
    "monthly_visit": 233,
    "monthly_download_resource": 3
}
```
- for resources:
```json
{
    "__id": 58728461,
    "resource_id": "5ffa8553-0e8f-4622-add9-5c0b593ca1f8",
    "dataset_id": "5c4ae55a634f4117716d5656",
    "metric_month": "2025-04",
    "monthly_download_resource": 5669
}
```
- for organizations:
```json
{
    "__id": 7,
    "organization_id": "646b7187b50b2a93b1ae3d45",
    "metric_month": "2023-07",
    "monthly_visit_dataset": 27196,
    "monthly_download_resource": 1085933,
    "monthly_visit_reuse": 123,
    "monthly_visit_dataservice": 456
}
```
- for published APIs (dataservices):
```json
{
    "__id": 249,
    "dataservice_id": "673b0e6774a23d9eac2af8ce",
    "metric_month": "2025-02",
    "monthly_visit": 6305
}
```

### 🛠️ Interacting with objects online
If you want to modify objects on the datagouv platforms, you will need to create an authenticated client:
```python
from datagouv import Client

client = Client(
    environment="www",  # here you can set which platform the client will interact with, default is production
    api_key="MY_SECRET_API_KEY",  # your API key, that grants your rights on the platform
    verbose=True,  # whether or not to display logs in the processes, default is True
)
```
> **Note:** You can find your API key on https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/admin/me/ (don't forget to change the prefix to get the key from the right environment).

Once your client is set up, you can instantiate datasets, resources, and published APIs from it. Of course, **you will only be allowed to modify objects according to your rights** (so objects created by you or an organization you are part of):
```python
dataset = client.dataset("5d13a8b6634f41070a43dff3")
# this is also a Dataset instance, with all the same attributes as above, but since you're authenticated, you have access to new methods

dataset.update({"title": "A brand new title"})  # update the dataset online with the payload you give, and also update the attributes of the object
print(dataset.title)  # -> "A brand new title"
dataset.delete()  # delete the dataset, use with caution!

# you can also modify the extras
dataset.update_extras(payload)
dataset.delete_extras(payload)

# the methods are the same for resources
for idx, res in enumerate(dataset.resources):
    res.update({"title": f"Resource n°{idx + 1}"})
    print(res.title)  # -> "Resource n°X"
    # delete every third resource
    if idx % 3 == 0:
        res.delete()


# it is also possible to sort a dataset's resources
# either with a specific Resource field and order, or with a custom sorting function that takes and returns a list of Resource objects
dataset.sort_resources(by="title.asc")  # the expected syntax is <field>.<order> (order being 'asc' or 'desc')

# published APIs (dataservices) work the same way
api = client.dataservice("673b0e6774a23d9eac2af8ce")
api.update({"title": "A brand new title"})
print(api.title)  # -> "A brand new title"
api.delete()  # delete the API, use with caution!
```

With an authenticated client, you are also allowed to create datasets, resources, and published APIs on the environment you specified:
```python
dataset = client.create_dataset(
    {
        "title": "New dataset",
        "description": "A description is required",
        "organization": "646b7187b50b2a93b1ae3d45",  # the organization that will own the dataset
    },
)  # this creates a dataset with the values you specified, and instantiates a Dataset
dataset.update({"tags": ["environment", "water"]})

# alternatively you can create a dataset from an organization, and it will be attached to it
organization = client.organization("646b7187b50b2a93b1ae3d45")
dataset = organization.create_dataset(
    {
        "title": "New dataset",
        "description": "A description is a required",
    }
)

# create a published API (dataservice on the platform)
api = client.create_dataservice(
    {
        "title": "New API",
        "description": "A description is required",
        "organization": "646b7187b50b2a93b1ae3d45",  # the organization that will own the API
    },
)  # this creates an API with the values you specified, and instantiates a Dataservice
api.update({"tags": ["transport"]})

# alternatively you can create an API from an organization, and it will be attached to it
api = organization.create_dataservice(
    {
        "title": "New API",
        "description": "A description is required",
    }
)
```
There are two types of resources on datagouv:
- `static`: a file is uploaded directly on the platform
- `remote`: reference the URL of a file that is stored somewhere else on the internet

You have two options to create a resource (of any type):
- from the client itself, by specifying the id of the dataset you want to include it into (you must have the rights on the dataset):
```python
# to create a static resource from a file
resource = client.create_static_resource(
    file_to_upload="path/to/your/file.txt",
    payload={"title": "New static resource"},
    dataset_id="5d13a8b6634f41070a43dff3",
)  # this creates a static resource with the values you specified, and instantiates a Resource

# to create a remote resource from an url
resource = client.create_remote_resource(
    payload={"url": "http://example.com/file.txt", "title": "New remote resource"},
    dataset_id="5d13a8b6634f41070a43dff3",
)  # this creates a remote resource with the values you specified, and instantiates a Resource
```
- from the dataset you want to include it into (you must have the rights on the dataset), in which case you don't have to specify the `dataset_id`:
```python
dataset = client.dataset("5d13a8b6634f41070a43dff3")
# to create a static resource from a file
resource = dataset.create_static(
    file_to_upload="path/to/your/file.txt",
    payload={"title": "New static resource"},
)  # this creates a static resource with the values you specified, and instantiates a Resource

# to create a remote resource from an url
resource = dataset.create_remote(
    payload={"url": "http://example.com/file.txt", "title": "New remote resource"},
)  # this creates a remote resource with the values you specified, and instantiates a Resource

# to update the file of a static resource
resource.update({"title": "New title"}, file_to_upload="path/to/your/new_file.txt")
```
> **Note:** If you are not planning to use an object's attributes, you may prevent the initial API call using `fetch=False`, in order not to unnecessarily ping the API.
```python
dataset = client.dataset("5d13a8b6634f41070a43dff3", fetch=False)
print(dataset.title)  # -> this will fail because the attributes are not set from the initial call
# but you can update the object as usual
dataset.update({"title": "New title"})
print(dataset.title)  # -> "New title"   because the attributes are set from the response
```

### ⚡ Advanced features
Many datagouv endpoints are paginated, which can make it tedious to retrieve all objects. An instance of `Client` has a method to create an iterator from any endpoint that returns paginated data:
```python
for obj in client.get_all_from_api_query(
    "api/1/datasets/?organization=534fff81a3a7292c64a77e5c",  # get all datasets from a specific organization
    mask="data{id,title,resources{id,title}}",  # you can apply a mask to retrieve only specific fields of the objects
    cast_as=Dataset,  # you can get the results as objects to manipulate them more easily
):
    print(f"Dataset {obj['title']} has {len(obj['resources'])} resources")  # if cast_as is not used, otherwise `obj.id` and `obj.resources`
```

You can also check if resources have been updated more recently than others:
```python
# Check if any resource in a dataset has been updated more recently than a specific resource
resource = Resource("f868cca6-8da1-4369-a78d-47463f19a9a3")
has_newer_updates = resource.check_if_more_recent_update("5d13a8b6634f41070a43dff3")
```

## 🤝 Contribution
Contributions and feedback are welcome! Main guidelines:
- as few API calls as possible (use responses to create/update objects)
- build on the existing

Remember to format, lint, and sort imports with [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) before committing (checks will remind you anyway):
```bash
pip install --group dev .
ruff check --fix .
ruff format .
```

### 🏷️ Release

The release process uses the [`tag_version.sh`](tag_version.sh) script to create git tags and update [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) and [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml) automatically.

**Prerequisites**: [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) (`gh`) must be installed and authenticated, and you must be on the main branch with a clean working directory.

```bash
# Create a new release
./tag_version.sh <version>

# Example
./tag_version.sh 2.5.0

# Dry run to see what would happen
./tag_version.sh 2.5.0 --dry-run
```

The script automatically:
- Updates the version in `pyproject.toml`
- Extracts commits since the last tag and formats them for `CHANGELOG.md`
- Identifies breaking changes (commits with `!:` in the subject)
- Creates a git tag and pushes it to the remote repository
- Creates a GitHub release with the changelog content
